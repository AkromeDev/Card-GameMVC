# Card game app

This is a simple card game app where the players draw cards out of a deck, the winner is the player that drew the highest card.

The goal of this code is to master the principles of the MVC and SOLID approaches.

If you see mistake/non respect of this principle in my code, please give me a feedback about it. I would appreciate it a lot
